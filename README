libmng 1.0.5-b1
---------------

First beta of a large maintenance release!

This completes support of the MNG specification to nearly 100% (PAST, PROM,
delta-images, BACK image+tile). It adds "dynamic" MNG and a few other neat
routines as well as fixes several bugs reported through SourceForge or to
me directly. The standard DLL is now compiled with lcms 1.0.9!
