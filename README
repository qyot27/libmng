libmng 1.0.5-b2
---------------

Second beta of the upcoming 1.0.5 release.

This addresses some minor problems detected during testing. It adds the
proposed change to the MNG spec as discussed on the "mng-list" recently;
eg. Adam's option 4.
And it adds a little function to check at run-time if the lib is a beta or not.
