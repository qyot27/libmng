libmng 1.0.5-rc1
----------------

Second release-candidate for the upcoming 1.0.5 version.

This contains fixes for a few minor details reported by the loyal testers.
It fixes some issues with the goframe/golayer/gotime processing and related
stuff. And it adds a way to disable playback-caching from within the MNG,
which is very useful for streaming-MNG encoders (such as gserver!).

We should have a final 1.0.5 version pretty soon!
